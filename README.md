# Dimentionality-Reduction-Using-PCA-LDA-and-ICA
This project applies clustering and dimensionality reduction (KMeans, PCA, LDA, ICA) to analyze high-dimensional datasets like Iris, Wine, and Breast Cancer. Visualizations and metrics (Silhouette Score, ARI) assess clustering quality and the impact of dimensionality reduction, enhancing interpretability and insights across datasets.
